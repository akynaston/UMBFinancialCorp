TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.set-creators-name=Set creatorsName on objects created in Identity Vault
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.max-replication-wait=The maximum eDirectory replication wait time controls the maximum time that the DirXML Engine will wait for a particular change to replicate between the local replica and a remote replica. This only affects operations where the DirXML Engine is required to contact a remote eDirectory server in the same tree to perform an operation and may need to wait until some change has replicated to or from the remote server before the operation can be completed (e.g. object moves when the DirXML server does not hold the master replica of the moved object ;file system rights operations for Users created from a template.)
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.rsaRealm=Enter the realm.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.use-calculated-values=Revert to calculated membership value behavior
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.pollRate=Enter the number of minutes the publisher channel should wait between polling the ACE server for updates.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.xslt-bc-mode=This control sets the XSLT processor used by the DirXML Engine to a backwards-compatible mode. The backwards-compatible mode causes the XSLT processor to use one or more behaviors that are not XPath 1.0 and/or XSLT 1.0 standards-compliant. This is done in the interest of backwards-compatiblity with existing DirXML stylesheets that depend on the non-standard behavior(s). \n \n In particular\: \n \n The behavior of the XPath "\!\=" operator when one operand is a node-set and the other operand is other than a node-set is incorrect in DirXML releases up to and including DirXML 2.0 (Novell Identity Manager 2.0). This behavior has been corrected; however, the corrected behavior is disabled by default through this control in favor of backwards-compatibility with existing DirXML stylesheets.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.allow-event-loopback=Allow event loopback from publisher to subscriber channel
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.rsaKeystoreFile=RSA Keystore File
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.pwd-sync-status=This control determines whether the DirXML Engine will report the status of subscriber channel password change events. \n \n Reporting the status of subscriber channel password change events allows applications such as the Identity Manager User Application to monitor the synchronization progress of a password change that should be synchronized to the connected application.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.retry-interval=Subscriber channel retry interval in seconds
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.retry-interval=The subscriber channel retry interval controls how frequently the DirXML Engine will retry the processing of a cached transaction after the application shim's Subscriber object returns a retry status.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.allow-event-loopback=This control determines whether the DirXML Engine will allow an event to loopback from the publisher channel of a driver to the subscriber channel of the same driver. Setting the control to false means that the loopback of the event from the publisher to the subscriber channel will not be allowed. Setting the control to true means that events would flow from the publisher channel to the subscriber channel of the same driver.  
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.use-pending-association=This control determines whether the DirXML Engine will write a pending association on an object during subscriber channel processing.\n \n Writing a pending association confers little or no benefit but does incur a performance penalty. Nevertheless, the option exists to turn it on for backward compatibility.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.pwd-sync-status=Enable password synchronization status reporting
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.pub-heartbeat-interval=Configures the driver shim to send a periodic status message on the publisher channel when there has been no publisher traffic for the given number of minutes.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.commandClientPassword=RSA Command Client Password
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.qualified-dn-values=Qualified form for DN-syntax attribute values
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.apiVersion=RSA API Version
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.commandClientUsername=RSA Command Client User
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.rsaKeystoreFile=Location for the RSA keystore file.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.choice.apiVersion.7.1.x=7.1.x
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.choice.disable.yes=yes
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.use-pending-association=Write pending associations
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.xslt-bc-mode=Use non-compliant backwards-compatible mode for XSLT
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.use-password-event-values=This control determines the source of the value reported for the nspmDistributionPassword attribute for subscriber channel add and modify events.\n \n Setting the control to false means that the current value of nspmDistributionPassword is obtained and reported as the value of the attribute event. This means that only the current password value is available. This is the default behavior.\n \n Setting the control to true means that the value recorded with the eDirectory event will be decrypted and reported as the value of the attribute event. This means that both the old password value (if it exists) and the replacement password value at the time of the event are available. This is useful for synchronizing passwords to certain applications that require the old password to enable setting a new password.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.disable=Disable publisher?
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.combine-template-values=This control determines how the DirXML Engine will use values from a template object when the template is used to create objects in the Identity Vault. Setting the control to true causes multi-valued attribute values from the template to be used in addition to those values for the same attribute that are  specified in the add operation. Setting the control to false causes the value(s) from the template to be ignored if there are values for the same attribute specified in the add operation.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.choice.disable.nodefault=no (default)
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.use-password-event-values=Use password event values
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.max-migrate-app-count=This control is used to limit the number of application objects that the DirXML Engine will request from an application during a single query that is performed as part of a "migrate objects from application" operation. \n \n If "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError" errors are encountered during a migrate from application operation then this number should be set lower than the default. \n \n Note that this control does not limit the number of application objects that can be migrated; it merely limits the "batch size".
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.qualified-rename-values=The qualified form for rename events controls whether the new-name portion of rename events coming from the Identity Vault are presented to the Subscriber channel with type qualifier(s) (e.g. CN\=). A "true" setting means the names are presented in qualified form.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.weblogicLibDir=The weblogic library directory contains the weblogic library and license.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.rsaRealm=RSA Realm
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.choice.apiVersion.6.1.x=6.1.x
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.qualified-dn-values=The qualified form for DN-syntax attribute values controls whether values for DN-syntax attribute values are presented in unqualified slash form or qualified slash form. A "true" setting means the values are presented in qualified form.
pkg.description=RSA Base Package
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.weblogicLibDir=Weblogic Library Directory
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.pub-heartbeat-interval=Publisher heartbeat interval in minutes
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.disable=Do you want to ignore events flowing from ACE to Identity Manager?
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.pollRate=Polling Interval in minutes
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.max-migrate-app-count=Maximum application objects to migrate at once
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.commandClientPassword=Enter the RSA command client password. e.g. eWTDf6yiet
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.set-creators-name=This control is used by the DirXML Engine to determine if the creatorsName attribute should be set to the DN of this driver on all objects created in the Identity Vault by this driver.\n \n Setting the creatorsName attribute allows for easily identifying objects created by this driver, but also carries a performance penalty. If not set, the creatorsName attribute will default to the DN of the NCP Server object that is hosting the driver.
pkg.name=RSA Base
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.commandClientUsername=Enter the RSA command client username. e.g. CmdClient_qytc0b7i
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.combine-template-values=Combine values from template object with those from add operation
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.param.dscr.apiVersion=RSA API Version.
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.use-calculated-values=Prior to Identity Manager 3.6 the DirXML Engine retrieved "calculated" values for the attributes "Member" and "Group Membership". The Engine now retrieves static values. This behavior is more generally useful and makes synchronizing Nested Groups possible. Setting this control to true reverts to the pre-3.6 behavior. \n \n It is possible even with the post-3.6 default behavior to read the calculated values for "Member" and "Group Membership" by using the special attribute names "[pseudo].Member" and "[pseudo].Group Membership".
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.max-replication-wait=Maximum eDirectory replication wait time in seconds
TRVRRSABASE.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.qualified-rename-values=Qualified form for rename events
